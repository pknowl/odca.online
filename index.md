## Welcome to Overlay Data Capture Architecture

ODCA is a standardized global solution for data capture and exchange which protects PII data and provides a positive alternative to current architectures.

A schema, a machine-readable definition of the semantics of a data structure, is typically created as a single data object. However, ODCA represents a schema as a multi-dimensional object consisting of a stable schema base and linked overlays, data objects that provide additional extensions, coloration, and functionality to the base object. Any sponsor can use a pre-existing schema base and build their own suite of linked overlays to add extra context to transform how information is displayed to a viewer or to guide an agent in how to apply a custom process to schema data.
